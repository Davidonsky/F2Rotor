# This test case aims to validate the function "GroundEffect.py", which calculates
# the ground effect correction coefficients for thr thrust and the power
# of the main rotor. For this Test Case an helicopter class has been defined
# with a generic main rotor radius of 10m. A generic ground distance of 4m 
# has been taken for this example.

# Authors: Andrea Iuliano, Michele Follo



# Input data
R_mr = 10  # Main rotor radius [m]
Height = 4 # Ground distance [m]
