#This test case script calculates aerodynamic coefficients for the wing of a simulated Pioneer 300 aircraft using Python.
#The script utilizes parameters such as wing span, wing chord, wing thickness ratio, and aspect ratio specific to the Pioneer 300, all defined in a configuration dictionary (config).
#Additionally, flight parameters such as cruise speed, altitude, speed of sound, kinematic viscosity, and density are specified to compute the Mach number and Reynolds number necessary for aerodynamic calculations.
