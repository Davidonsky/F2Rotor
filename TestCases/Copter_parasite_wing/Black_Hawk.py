
#This test case script calculates aerodynamic coefficients for the horizontal stabilizer of a simulated Sirosky UH-60 Black Hawk using Python.
#The script utilizes parameters such as wing span, wing chord, wing thickness ratio, and aspect ratio specific to the copter selected, all defined in a configuration dictionary (config).
#Additionally, flight parameters such as cruise speed, altitude, speed of sound, kinematic viscosity, and density are specified to compute the Mach number and Reynolds number necessary for aerodynamic calculations.
