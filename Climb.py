#Copter climb F2ROTOR
#The climb performance of a helicopter is determined by its ability to convert available power into vertical ascent.
#The primary factors influencing this performance are the available power, the power required by the rotors, the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW), and the horizontal flight speed.
#- Available Power (Pd): This is the total power output provided by the helicopter's engines.
#- Rotor Power (Pn): This includes the power consumed by both the main rotor and the tail rotor.
#- Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW): This is the maximum weight at which the helicopter is certified to take off.
#- Horizontal Flight Speed (Voo): This is the speed at which the helicopter is moving horizontally.

#The theory behind this code can be found in: Giovanni Di Giorgio - "Lezioni integrative dell'insegnamento di Aerodinamica dell'Ala Rotante" - a.a. 2023/2024 - page 89.
