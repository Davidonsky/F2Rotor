
#This function calculates the aerodynamic drag characteristics of a wing through a series of empirical and theoretical calculations, including factors for skin friction,
#compressibility, and interference. The function uses inputs such as wing span, chord length, wing thickness, and aspect ratio from a configuration dictionary. 
#It also takes into account freestream conditions like Mach number and Reynolds number.It computes the dimensional and non dimensional drag coefficient.

#The theory behind this code can be found in: Carlo De Nicola - "Appunti per il corso di Aerodinamica degli Aeromiboili" - a.a. 2018/2019 - Appendice E.
